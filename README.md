### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aidan (he/him). Currently in my 4th (and final) year at the University of Nottingham, studying for my MSci Computer Science degree.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

#### **Lab Monitor**!

A project which started from a personal problem of mine from a year ago.
As teaching moved back to in person, the lab spaces in the CS department were often booked for teaching.
I found it difficult to keep track of which labs were when, and I wanted an easy way to plan my day so
I could know what rooms to avoid and when. After I gained some knowledge about Flutter, I decided to
finally start making the app for myself.

Some interest grew amongst students, and I am now in the process of receiving approval from the school
for it to be used and made available to students on the Google Play and iOS App stores.

It's expanded from a small lab calendar, to now include live user reports for when rooms are busy at
unexpected times, and as a way for students and staff to submit issues with equipment through the app
via QR location codes.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

**Flutter** for app development, but would love to do more work on native Android

**Ktor**, to scratch my Kotlin itch while working on Lab Monitor, with the **Exposed** framework to interface
with the database.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

UI/UX Designs!

### ðŸ‘€ I'm looking forward to ...

#### **Advent of Code** ðŸŽ„

A highlight of the year for me! Competing in the UoN CS Leaderboard and discussing solutions (after we've solved them...)
is always fun, and I always end up learning a lot about whichever languages I use (previously C, Python, and Kotlin!)
