### 🖥️ **Lab Monitor**

*Currently out of action. Please reach out if you'd like to use Lab Monitor as a base for
your own projects, or to revive it at UoN!*

A project which started from a personal problem of mine from a year ago.
As teaching moved back to in person, the lab spaces in the CS department were often booked for teaching.
I found it difficult to keep track of which labs were when, and I wanted an easy way to plan my day so
I could know what rooms to avoid and when. After I gained some knowledge about Flutter, I decided to
finally start making the app for myself.

Some interest grew amongst students, and the app is now available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lab-monitor/id6443952035)
and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aidandagnall.lab_monitor)!

It's expanded from a small lab calendar, to now include live user reports for when rooms are busy at
unexpected times, and as a way for students and staff to submit issues with equipment through the app
via QR location codes.

### **Advent of Code** 🎄

Every December, 25 puzzles are released on the build up the Christmas, and it's always something I'm looking forward to. I've been attempting it since 2019, and completed from 2020 onwards. Find my solutions [here](https://github.com/aidandagnall/advent)!
