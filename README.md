### Hi there 👋

I'm Aidan (he/him), a Gradudate Software Engineer at [Wise](https://wise.com) working towards money without borders.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

Dynamic Flow @ Wise!

### 📆 What I've worked on in the past ...

#### **Lab Monitor**!

**Currently out of action. Please reach out if you'd like to use Lab Monitor as a base for
your own projects, or to revive it at UoN!**

A project which started from a personal problem of mine from a year ago.
As teaching moved back to in person, the lab spaces in the CS department were often booked for teaching.
I found it difficult to keep track of which labs were when, and I wanted an easy way to plan my day so
I could know what rooms to avoid and when. After I gained some knowledge about Flutter, I decided to
finally start making the app for myself.

Some interest grew amongst students, and the app is now available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lab-monitor/id6443952035)
and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aidandagnall.lab_monitor)!

It's expanded from a small lab calendar, to now include live user reports for when rooms are busy at
unexpected times, and as a way for students and staff to submit issues with equipment through the app
via QR location codes.

### 👀 I'm looking forward to ...

#### **Advent of Code** 🎄

Coming up to my first AoC as a non-student, I fear the 5am GMT starts may not be possible any longer. That being said,
I am obviously still looking forward to competing and discussing solutions again in December. With less free time,
completing all 25 days by Christmas may not be on the cards - but I will certainly try.
